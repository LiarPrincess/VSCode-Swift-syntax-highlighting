## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-22

### Added

- SQL injection grammar (`syntaxes/injection.tmLanguage.json`) that adds syntax highlighting in `String` literals.

- Extension that overrides the `middleware.provideDocumentSemanticTokens` in the official Swift extension to remove the `tokenType` from `String` literals (other token types stay the same). This way the TextMate grammar (including our injection) will take over over.
